# Java AsyncTask

A port of Android SDK's AsyncTask for plain Java.

AsyncTask is a utility library that ports the Android SDK's AsyncTask class for use in plain Java applications.
It enables the easier use of threads in Java applications by allowing you to perform operations on non-UI threads and publish their results on the UI thread without having to deal with Threads, Executors and Handlers. AsyncTask does not follow any framework or specific SDK, so you can use it in any plain Java (or Java EE) application. However, it should not be used within the Android SDK, where the use of the native AsyncTask class should be highly preferred.

<b>The package requires Java 8+</b>
